<h3 align="center">About me</h3>

**Hello!** I'm a programmer from Russia.
For a long time I was engaged in the development of conventional software for Windows and had about 20 active projects with an audience. At the moment, I have expanded my skills and am already developing neural networks, websites, server software. One of the main distinguishing skills is the reverse and protection of software from reverse engineering.
